# DotNetRexx
Interpreter for the REXX language in .Net languages. 

Written in Visual Basic, with an application program that demonstrates its use.

A specialized version is used in my Xedit project, simplified in some aspects, extended in others, to satisfiy the tipical needs for the editor in which it is uses as the command language.
