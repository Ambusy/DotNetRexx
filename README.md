# DotNetRexx
Interpreter for the REXX language in .Net languages. 

Written in Visual Basic, with an application program that demonstrates its use.

A specialized version is used in my Xedit project, simplified in some aspects, extended in others, to satisfiy the typical needs for the editor in which it is used for driving the command language. 


To run the project in Visual Studio, you might need to open the My Project tab and adjust the .NET framework version, as installed on your pc.
